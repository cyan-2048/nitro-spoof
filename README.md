# goosemod plugin for sending all emojis without nitro

## How to use:
1. go to plugins 
2. cloud icon in top right corner 
3. paste this into the url bar: <br>
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luimu64/nitro-spoof/gm-master/dist/modules.json`

4. search and add the plugin like any other from the store

I didn't bother setting the up the repo properly so there is no pgp

## Cons:
- if emoji is put in message with text the link will be visible
- size scales resolution instead of the actual size resulting in pixelated images if size is set too small

## To do:

- [x] settings for changing emoji size
- [ ] sending emojis as separate message if message has text
- [ ] stickers (if even possible)
- [ ] reactions (if even possible)
