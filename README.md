# goosemod plugin for sending all emojis without nitro

## Weaknesses:
- if emoji is put in message with text the link will be visible
- size scales resolution instead of the actual size resulting in pixelated images if size is set too small

## To do:

- [x] settings for changing emoji size
- [ ] sending emojis as separate message if message has text
- [ ] stickers (if even possible)
- [ ] reactions (if even possible)
